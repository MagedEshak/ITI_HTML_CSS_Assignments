                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p style="width: 75%; height: 120px; overflow: auto;">
                    My name is Maged Eshak. I am 25 years old and from Assiut. I graduated from the Faculty of Computers
                    and
                    Information at
                    the Egyptian E-Learning University in 2023. I have a strong passion for web development and am
                    currently
                    studying .NET
                    to become a Full Stack Developer.

                    I have worked on various projects, including a website for booking five-a-side football fields using
                    .NET. I
                    also
                    collaborated on an E-Commerce website with a friend and worked as a Front-End Developer on a project
                    that
                    used
                    Python to
                    identify missing persons in images.

                    On a personal level, I am a social person who thrives under pressure, and I believe this will become
                    even
                    more
                    evident
                    when I join ITI and start working in a professional environment. In general, I am always eager to
                    learn
                    new
                    things and
                    improve myself, which is what led me to this field. I am very excited to join ITI to enhance my .NET
                    skills
                    and
                    take my
                    web development expertise to the next level.

                    "I want to join ITI for several important reasons. Firstly, ITI's reputation in the field of
                    information
                    technology in
                    Egypt is excellent. The institute is known for the quality of its training and the strong curriculum
                    it
                    offers,
                    especially in the Full Stack .Net track, which I am very interested in. I believe your curriculum
                    covers
                    all
                    the aspects
                    I need to become a professional web developer in .Net, from front-end to back-end, and with the
                    technologies
                    that major
                    companies use. Secondly, the high employment rate of ITI graduates is very encouraging to me and
                    assures
                    me
                    that the
                    institute genuinely prepares graduates for the job market, and that my chances of finding a good job
                    after
                    graduating
                    from ITI will be high. Thirdly, the institute's values, such as professionalism, passion, and
                    loyalty,
                    are
                    values I
                    agree with and see as very important in any workplace, and I would like to be in a work environment
                    that
                    respects these
                    values. In short, I believe ITI is the place that will help me achieve my goal of becoming a
                    distinguished
                    and in-demand
                    .Net web developer in the job market, and this is the main reason why I am very excited to join
                    you."
