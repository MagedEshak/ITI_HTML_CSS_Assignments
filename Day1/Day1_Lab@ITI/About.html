        My name is Maged Eshak. I am 25 years old and from Assiut. I graduated from the Faculty of Computers and
        Information at
        the Egyptian E-Learning University in 2023. I have a strong passion for web development and am currently
        studying .NET
        to become a Full Stack Developer.

        I have worked on various projects, including a website for booking five-a-side football fields using
        .NET. I
        also
        collaborated on an E-Commerce website with a friend and worked as a Front-End Developer on a project
        that
        used
        Python to
        identify missing persons in images.

        On a personal level, I am a social person who thrives under pressure, and I believe this will become
        even
        more
        evident
        when I join ITI and start working in a professional environment. In general, I am always eager to learn
        new
        things and
        improve myself, which is what led me to this field. I am very excited to join ITI to enhance my .NET
        skills
        and
        take my
        web development expertise to the next level.

        "I want to join ITI for several important reasons. Firstly, ITI's reputation in the field of information
        technology in
        Egypt is excellent. The institute is known for the quality of its training and the strong curriculum it
        offers,
        especially in the Full Stack .Net track, which I am very interested in. I believe your curriculum covers
        all
        the aspects
        I need to become a professional web developer in .Net, from front-end to back-end, and with the
        technologies
        that major
        companies use. Secondly, the high employment rate of ITI graduates is very encouraging to me and assures
        me
        that the
        institute genuinely prepares graduates for the job market, and that my chances of finding a good job
        after
        graduating
        from ITI will be high. Thirdly, the institute's values, such as professionalism, passion, and loyalty,
        are
        values I
        agree with and see as very important in any workplace, and I would like to be in a work environment that
        respects these
        values. In short, I believe ITI is the place that will help me achieve my goal of becoming a
        distinguished
        and in-demand
        .Net web developer in the job market, and this is the main reason why I am very excited to join you."
